# Chess Game Assets

This project includes various assets used for the chess game application. Below is a brief overview of the assets and their purposes:

## Chess Pieces

The chess pieces are represented by images/icons that visually depict each type of piece. These images are used in the `Piece` component to render the appropriate piece on the board.

## Board Design

The chessboard is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly. The squares alternate in color to create a classic chessboard appearance.

## Usage

Ensure that all asset files are correctly referenced in the components to display the chess pieces and board as intended. 

## Contribution

If you wish to add or modify any assets, please follow the naming conventions and ensure that the new assets are compatible with the existing components.
