// This file contains functions for implementing chess rules, including isValidMove, checkForCheckmate, handleCastling, handleEnPassant, and promotePawn. These functions validate moves and update the game state accordingly.

export const isValidMove = (piece, from, to, board) => {
    // Implement logic to validate if the move is valid based on the piece type and current board state
};

export const checkForCheckmate = (board, currentPlayer) => {
    // Implement logic to check if the current player is in checkmate
};

export const handleCastling = (kingPosition, rookPosition, board) => {
    // Implement logic for castling move
};

export const handleEnPassant = (pawnPosition, targetPosition, board) => {
    // Implement logic for en passant move
};

export const promotePawn = (pawnPosition, promotionType, board) => {
    // Implement logic for pawn promotion
};
